# Cryptography in Work
This is a simple project demonstrating the Ceaser and Affine ciphers in work. 
The user is able to encrypt a message using one of the two ciphers by entering a phrase to be encrypted and the appropriate number of keys.

## Motivation 
Although both of these ciphers are no longer used, I thought it would be a great starting point for further exploration into cryptography.
